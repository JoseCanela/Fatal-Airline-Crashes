# Probabilistic Predictions of Fatal Airline Crashes â€“ Extreme Value Theory
## Overview
* Developed a probabilistic model that estimates the probability of a fatal U.S. aircraft crash in the world via extreme event distributions such as the Pareto and Poisson distributions.
* This effort consisted of utilizing open source *National Transportation Safety Board* (NTSB) air-crash time series data (utilizing **ArcPy and HTTP REST API**), **data wrangling** (employing **Pandas and NumPy**), and **probabilistic model development** (exploiting *extreme value theory*) as a foundation for both ***extreme air-event prediction and mapping***.
